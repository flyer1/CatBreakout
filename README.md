## Get Started
If you want to run this code locally you will need nodejs installed on your machine.
- [nodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) - Breaks javascript free from the shackles of the browser and makes it avaiable in a regular process!

#### 1. Get Code
Once node is installed, download a copy of the code to your local machine and unzip (or use git to clone it (`git clone https://github.com/flyer1/CatBreakout.git`)) 

#### 2. Get NPM Packages
CD to the top level directory of the code and type in a console:

```
npm ci
```

(if npm command is not found, then it is not part of your path (or you haven't restarted a console in order to let the path updates take effect)).

#### 3. Run the game
From the top level folder of the source code (ie: you will see the src & node_modules folders) type 

```
ng serve
```

This will build and host the angular app.
Navigate to (http://localhost:4200/) in your browser to play the game!


This project was made with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.2.
